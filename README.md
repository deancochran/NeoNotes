# Hello World!

Welcome to my journey through the complex world of vim! I'm only just now starting this journey with 
hopes that as I become more fluent with the architecture, and obvious gain the performance benefits of utilizing vim to it's full potential.

Okay let's begin

# Goal
To have a neovim editor configured on github, such that the only thing I would need to install if I want to use neovim elsewhere, would be a language syntax, and the actual neovim application. I've read mainly about the configuration process, which I assume can be saved into the cloud.


# Installation process
This wasn't to hard. I use two systems at the moment, Ubuntu and MacOS. For MacOS use 'brew' and for Ubuntu use 'apt' to install the latest version of neovim.
